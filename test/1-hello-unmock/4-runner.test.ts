// the runner is a powerful way to catch bugs
// let's rewrite the reply so that it uses u.type, whose
// first argument generates required properties of an
// objet and whose second argument generates optional
// properties of an argument. so, our API is making
// `isAdmin` required and `age` optional.

// The runner may work for a few iterations, but eventually
// it will fail for at least two reasons due to bugs in the function.
// Can you see why? Can you propose a sensible
// fix to the function without changing the API?

// let's use the same function, but with indeterminate results
// we accomplish this using the `u` syntax in the reply method
// below.

// but wait, something does not seem quite right in the reply bloc...
// we are generating an `id` field, but where did our `isAdmin`
// field go? can you see how to generate it?
