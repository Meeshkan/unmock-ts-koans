// sometimes, we want to make sure that a function
// called an API exactly like it should. this is
// called a side effect, and to determine information about
// side effects, unmock uses spies.

// you'll see that below, we are expecting that the path will
// have a certain form, but it looks like we're using the
// wrong method on the spy! we didn't call a post method, so the spy
// will not yield the right value. can you change the method
// to the right one? a list of valid spy methods is
// on the unmock readme
