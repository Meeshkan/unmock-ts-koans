# unmock-ts-koans

Koans are a great way to learn a new language or library. These koans will teach you how to use unmock in typescript.

## Running the koans

First, install the dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn
```

Then, run the first koan.

```bash
$ yarn test-1
```

It will fail, and there are comments in the [first test file](test/1-hello-unmock/1-a-simple-test.test.ts) with hints on how to fix it.

Once you get this koan to pass, congratulate yourself! Then, run the second koan.

```bash
$ yarn test-2
```

And so on and so forth until you have run all of the koans.

Then, when you are done, you can bask in the glory of lots of correct koans by running the following.

```bash
$ yarn test
```
